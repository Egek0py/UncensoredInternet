How it Works

Uncensored Internet utilizes various techniques to bypass internet censorship and restrictions. These techniques include:

DNS leak prevention: It prevents leaks of your DNS requests, which could reveal your browsing activity to your ISP.
Tor connections: It facilitates connections to the Tor network, which anonymizes your traffic by routing it through a distributed network of relays.
Proxy servers: It allows you to connect to the internet through an intermediary server, masking your IP address and location.
VPN connections: It establishes a secure tunnel between your device and a VPN server, encrypting your internet traffic.
MAC address spoofing: It allows you to change your device's MAC address, making it more difficult to track your online activity.
